# Introduction #

The Mosquino design includes a realtime clock (RTC) that provides the time of day and an alarm function that can wake the CPU from all sleep modes. The RTC makes it easy to implement time-based scheduling and power management. For example, a data logger can be easily configured to take a measurement once per hour, sleeping at very low power between readings.

[DS1337 Library](http://code.google.com/p/mosquino/downloads/list?q=label:realtime%20clock)

# Features #

  * Work with time either in date/time (e.g. month/day/year) format or in UTC (seconds since the Unix epoch)
  * Get and set alarms
  * Conversion from calendar dates to UTC and vice versa
  * Snooze function puts the CPU to sleep (at a few uA) for the desired number of seconds and wakes using an interrupt.
  * Date/time range supported: 1/1/2000 thru 12/31/2099

# Notes & Cautions #

Because this library uses the Arduino Wire library, and the Wire library is interrupt driven, you cannot use any function that reads or writes to the DS1337 while interrupts are disabled (such as following a noInterrupts() statement or from inside an interrupt service routine).

# Details #

On the Mosquino board, the DS1337 realtime clock IC is permanently connected to the I2C SDA/SCL lines, and the ATMega's INT2 pin. An optional 12mm coin battery (holder located on the underside of the board) keeps the clock operating when the board is unpowered. When the board is powered, power for the realtime clock is supplied from Vdd instead.

For efficiency, functions that get and set individual time elements (hour, minute, etc.) actually operate on a temporary buffer (not the RTC directly), and you explicitly read its contents from the chip or write them to it. See the readTime() and writeTime() functions below.

There are functions available to work with dates and times in either the conventional mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss format, or in "[Unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)" (also known as Unix Time Stamp (UTS) or epoch seconds). This is the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight on January 1st, 1970 (generally a very large number). This may seem a little odd, but it's a well-known and widely-supported standard. Working directly in seconds makes working with relative time (e.g. "wake me every 320 seconds") and adding/subtracting dates and times much easier than working with calendar dates with all their funny variable-length months, leap years and such.

## Use in a Sketch ##

Include the DS1337 library and the Arduino Wire library, which provides access to the clock via I2C:

```
#include <DS1337.h>
#include <Wire.h>
```

If you will be using power-management functions such as sleep(...) in your sketch, include the standard AVR power and sleep headers too:

```
#include <avr/power.h>
#include <avr/sleep.h>
```

Then, create an instance of the DS1337 library:

```
DS1337 RTC = DS1337();
```

This creates an instance named RTC for use in your sketch.

In your setup() function, ensure the clock's interrupt pin is set as an input, and that its pull-up resistor is enabled:

```
  pinMode(PIN_INT2, INPUT);
  digitalWrite(PIN_INT2, HIGH);
```

When first powered, the realtime clock starts up in a powered-down state with no time set. To use it in your sketch, first ensure it is powered up and running:

```
RTC.start();
```

If your sketch needs to know the absolute time of day (rather than relative time between successive clock reads), check if the time has been previously set and set it if necessary. In the example below it is simply set to 1/1/2000, but you might also ask the user or obtain it from an attached PC, etc.

```
  if(!RTC.time_is_set()) // set a time, if none set already...
  {
    Serial.println("Clock not set, setting to epoch (1/1/2000).");
    // set initially to epoch
    RTC.setSeconds(0);
    RTC.setMinutes(0);
    RTC.setHours(0);
    RTC.setDays(1);
    RTC.setMonths(1);
    RTC.setYears(2000);
    RTC.writeTime();
  }
```

Remember, functions that operate on individual time elements (hour, etc.) are actually working on a **memory copy** of the chip contents. The final call. RTC.writeTime(), is what actually writes the in-memory copy to the chip. Likewise, readTime() reads the chip contents to memory so that functions like getSeconds(), etc. will return the current time.

## Functions ##

### Basic control and reading/writing time ###

**`void DS1337::start(void)`**

Enables the realtime clock and starts its oscillator. The RTC must be enabled in order to keep time. The RTC draws approximately 1uA of current when enabled.


**`void DS1337::stop(void)`**

Stops the realtime clock's oscillator, freezing its current time. By using the start() and stop() functions, the RTC can be used like a stopwatch (times can still be written and read while stopped, but the time will not advance).

**`unsigned char DS1337::time_is_set()`**

Returns TRUE if the time has been set since the last time the chip was powered, FALSE otherwise. Note, this only tells that the RTC has not lost power since the last writeTime() occurred; it does NOT guarantee the time written is correct or obtained from a reliable source.

**`void DS1337::readTime(void)`**

Reads the current calendar date and time from the RTC to the memory buffer. This must be called before reading individual time elements such as getSeconds().

**`void DS1337::writeTime(void)`**

Writes the current calendar date and time from the memory buffer to the RTC. This should be called after setting individual time elements, e.g. setSeconds().

**`void DS1337::writeTime(unsigned long unixtime)`**

Writes a time specified in Unix time stamp format to the RTC. The Unix time stamp is converted to calendar date/time in the memory buffer (replacing any existing contents), then transferred to the RTC.

**`unsigned char DS1337::getSeconds()`**

**`unsigned char DS1337::getMinutes()`**

**`unsigned char DS1337::getHours()`**

**`unsigned char DS1337::getDays()`**

**`unsigned char DS1337::getDayOfWeek()`**

**`unsigned char DS1337::getMonths()`**

**`unsigned int DS1337::getYears()`**

Reads individual calendar date/time elements from the memory buffer. Remember, call readTime() first to ensure you are working with a fresh copy.

**`void DS1337::setSeconds(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setMinutes(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setHours(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setDays(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setDayOfWeek(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setMonths(unsigned char v)`**

**`void DS1337::setYears(unsigned int v)`**

Writes individual calendar date/time elements to the memory buffer. Remember, call writeTime() when finished to transfer the new date/time from the memory buffer to the RTC.

### Power Management ###

**`void DS1337::snooze(unsigned long secondsToSnooze)`**

Puts the CPU in its lowest-power sleep mode (SLEEP\_MODE\_PWR\_DOWN) for the number of seconds specified. The previous sleep mode, if any, will be restored upon exiting. This function works by converting the current time to epoch seconds, adding the number specified, setting an alarm for the resulting time and sleeping until the alarm interrupt. The DS1337's alarm can be set for a maximum of approximately 1 month into the future (28-31 days depending on the current month). 28 days is 2,419,200 seconds.

**`void DS1337::custom_snooze(unsigned long secondsToSnooze)`**

Same as the snooze() function, but does not explicitly set any sleep mode, allowing snoozing at any (previously set) sleep or idle mode.


### Alarms ###

**`unsigned char DS1337::alarm_is_set()`**

Returns TRUE if an alarm is currently set (i.e. the alarm interrupt is enabled), FALSE otherwise.

**`void DS1337::readAlarm(void)`**

Reads the RTC's current alarm date/time to the memory buffer. You can then use getSeconds() through getDays() to read it. NOTE: The DS1337's alarm only supports seconds through days (months and larger time units are not supported). Thus the longest duration the alarm can be set for is approximately one month into the future.

**`void DS1337::writeAlarm(void)`**

Writes the current memory buffer contents (seconds through days) to the RTC as an alarm value. This function writes the alarm time only; it does not set the alarm. Use enable\_interrupt() to set the alarm interrupt.

NOTE: The DS1337's alarm only supports seconds through days (months and larger time units are not supported). Thus the longest duration the alarm can be set for is approximately one month into the future.

**`void DS1337::writeAlarm(unsigned long unixtime)`**

Writes an alarm time to the RTC using the provided Unix time value. Again, this only sets the alarm time (use enable\_interrupt() to turn on the alarm), and the maximum alarm duration is approximately one month into the future.

**`void DS1337::setAlarmRepeat(byte repeat)`**

Sets the alarm repeat rate. The allowed values are:
| EVERY\_SECOND |
|:--------------|
| EVERY\_MINUTE |
| EVERY\_HOUR |
| EVERY\_DAY |
| EVERY\_WEEK |
| EVERY\_MONTH |

On the DS1337 there is no explicit value to disable alarm repeats entirely. If a single alarm is desired, set the repeat value to EVERY\_MONTH and disable it after it goes off the first time.

**`unsigned char DS1337::enable_interrupt()`**

Enables the alarm interrupt, effectively setting the alarm. By attaching a user-defined function to the INT2 interrupt (using attachInterrupt(...)), the user function can be called, or the CPU woken from sleep, when the alarm goes off. NOTE: The interrupt must be cleared, using clear\_interrupt() (outside of the user-defined interrupt service routine), before a new interrupt can occur.

**`unsigned char DS1337::disable_interrupt()`**

Disables the alarm interrupt.

**`unsigned char DS1337::clear_interrupt()`**

Clears the alarm interrupt. This should be called from user code after an alarm interrupt occurs. NOTE: Because the Wire (I2C) library uses interrupts, this must not be called from inside an interrupt service routine or when interrupts are otherwise disabled (e.g. inside a noInterrupts() block).

### Conversions ###

**`unsigned long DS1337::date_to_epoch_seconds(unsigned int year, byte month, byte day, byte hour, byte minute, byte second)`**

Given a time in individual date/time values, return the corresponding Unix Time Stamp (seconds since midnight on Jan 1 1970).

**`unsigned long DS1337::date_to_epoch_seconds()`**

Using the time currently in the memory buffer, return the corresponding Unix Time Stamp.

**`void DS1337::epoch_seconds_to_date(unsigned long unixtime)`**

Given a Unix Time Stamp, convert to the corresponding calendar date/time. The result is returned in the memory buffer and can be read using getSeconds(), etc.


### Low Level ###

These functions are for specific needs or advanced users. Most users will not need to use this stuff.

**`unsigned char DS1337::getRegister(unsigned char registerNumber)`**

**`void DS1337::setRegister(unsigned char registerNumber, unsigned char value)`**

Read or write raw register values from the DS1337. Refer to the [DS1337 data sheet](http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/DS1337-DS1337C.pdf) for the on-chip register map.

**`byte DS1337::bcd2bin(byte v)`**

**`byte DS1337::bin2bcd(byte v)`**

Convert between a normal numeric (integer) value and [Binary Coded Decimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal) format. This format is occasionally required by devices such as LCD and LED character displays.
